# **OH!**
## *Oh?*

#### Description
*Oh* is an esoteric(?) programming language you can try out in the browser: >Insert link here<

#### Help
Oh? You're wondering how it works? Well there's the example on the website...
and other than that you'll have to try a bit ğŸ˜¬. (And maybe don't look at the [code](#Code) yet.)
Part of the fun is also figuring out if&how you can even build *"useful"* things with it. I certainly don't know.
The idea for the language just was suddenly in my brain. *Oh!*

#### Code
The code quality is kind of terrible as I hacked this together in two days...
Also the website looks really neat doesn't it? For my part, I am proud of me.

Feel free to dive in and change whatever you want, I'm happy to take a look at it. (And devour it.)
